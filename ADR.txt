- The constructor() class should only register default values and events; do not inspect attributes or descendents, or add new ones in this class
- Components use closing tags to signal that they're Web Components
- Attributes are used for states and variants, not for content
- Attributes must be lowercase
- Content is placed in <slot>
- component-level CSS should always be loaded after global CSS to ensure proper cascade inheritance
- Components and their inner workings inherit from Global CSS first, then apply their own overrides
- All component-level CSS is in the single component .js file
